## Inspector

Public trait for adding `.inspect()` method for popular data-stuctures.

## Changelog

0.0.5 - "inspect-release" replaced with "debug-only". It is opt-out, rather
        than opt-in. By default it resembles other `inspect()` methods
        in std library.

0.0.4 - "inspect-release" feature to enable inspection in release mode.
        (opt-in)
